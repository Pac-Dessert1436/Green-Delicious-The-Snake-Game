# Green Delicious - The Snake Game 

This mini-game is carefully written for three days as a WinForm project.

Basic code of the project is provided by artificial intelligence, but after that
I was dedicated to enriching and refactoring code, so the A.I. only did a small
part of the entire project.

The only limitation of this project is that the background music and the sound
effects can't be played simutaneously, owing to the SoundPlayer class.
